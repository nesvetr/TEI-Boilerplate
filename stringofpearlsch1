                    <p>BEFORE <placeName>Fleet-street</placeName> had reached its present importance, and when <persName>George the Third</persName> was young, and the <persName>two figures</persName> that used to strike the chimes at <placeName>old <persName>St. Dunstan</persName>'s church</placeName> were in all their glory--being a great impediment to errand-boys on their progress, and a matter of gaping curiosity to country people--there stood close to the sacred edifice a small barber's shop, which was kept by a man of the name of <persName>Sweeney Todd</persName>.</p>
                    
                    <p>How it was that he came by the name of <persName>Sweeney</persName>, as a Christian <note>appellation</note>, we are at a loss to conceive, but such was his name, as might be seen in extremely corpulent yellow letters over his shop window, by any who there chose to look for it.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Barbers by that time in <placeName>Fleet-street</placeName> had not become fashionable, and no more dreamt of calling themselves artists than of taking the <placeName>tower</placeName> by storm; moreover, they were not, as they are now, consistently <note>slaughtering fine fat bears</note>, and yet, somehow people had hair on their heads just the same as they have at present, without the aid of that <note>unctuous auxiliary</note>. Moreover, <persName>Sweeney Todd</persName>, in common with those really primitive sort of times, did not think it at all necessary to have any <note>waxen effigies of humanity</note> in his window. There was no languishing young lady looking over the left shoulder in order that a profusion of auburn tresses might repose upon her lily neck, and great conquerors and great statesmen were not then, as they are now, held up to public ridicule with dabs of rouge upon their cheeks, a quantity of gunpowder scattered in their beard, and some bristles sticking on end for eyebrows.</p>
                    
                    <p>No, <persName>Sweeney Todd</persName> was a barber of the old school, and he never thought of glorifying himself on account of any extraneous circumstance. If he had lived in <persName>Henry the Eighth</persName>'s palace, it would be all the same as <persName>Henry the Eighth</persName>'s dog-kennel, and he would scarcely have believed human nature to be so <note>green</note> as to pay an extra sixpence to be shaven and shorn in any particular locality.</p>
                    
                    <p>A long pole painted white, with a red stripe curling spirally round it, projected into the street from his doorway, and on one of the panes of glass in his window, was presented the following couplet:--</p>
                    
                    <p>"Easy shaving for a penny,<lb/>As good as you will find any."</p>
                    
                    <p>We do not put these lines forth as a specimen of the poetry of the age; they may have been the production of some young <note>Templar</note>; but if they were a little wanting in poetic fire, that was amply made up by the clear and precise manner in which they set forth what they intended.</p>
                    
                    <p>The barber himself was a long, low-jointed, ill-put-together sort of fellow, with an immense mouth, and such huge hands and feet, that he was, in his way, quite a <note>natural curiosity</note>; and what was more wonderful, considering his trade, there never was seen such a head of hair as <persName>Sweeney Todd</persName>'s. We know not what to compare it to; probably it came nearest to what one might suppose to be the appearance of a thick-set hedge, in which a quantity of small wire had got entangled. In truth, it was a most terrific head of hair; and as <persName>Sweeney Todd</persName> kept all his combs in it--some people said his scissors likewise--when he put his head out of the shop-door to see what sort of weather it was, he might have been mistaken for an Indian warrior with a very remarkable head-dress.</p>
                    
                    <p>He had a short disagreeable kind of unmirthful laugh, which came in at all sorts of odd times when nobody else saw anything to laugh at at all, and which sometimes made people start again, especially when they were being shaved, and <persName>Sweeney Todd</persName> would stop short in that operation to indulge in one of those <note>cachinatory effusions</note>. It was evident that the remembrance of some very strange and <pb n="2"/> out-of-the-way joke must occasionally flit across him, and then he gave his hyena-like laugh, but it was so short, so sudden, striking upon the ear for a moment, and then gone, that people have been known to look up at the ceiling, and on the floor, and all round them, to know from whence it had come, scarcely supposing it possible that it had proceeded from mortal lips. </p>
